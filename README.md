ANN from scratch with numpy.

Supports binary classification. Support for multi-class classification may be added in the future

Using this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

To add:
  - automatic support for sparse scipy arrays (use for BoW feature vectors)
  - leaky relu, softmax
  - options for stochastic and batch gradient descent
  - L1, L2, and dropout regularization
