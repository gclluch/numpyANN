ANN from scratch with numpy.

Supports binary classification. Now supports L2 regularization. Support for multi-class classification may be added in the future.

Using these datasets:

  - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+#

To add:
  - automatic support for sparse scipy arrays (use for BoW feature vectors)
  - leaky relu, softmax
  - options for stochastic and batch gradient descent
  - dropout regularization
